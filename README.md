<p>This code forms backend of a website feature where user can upload phosphoproteomic data, define threshold parameters and visualise the analysis of the data. The output is divided into three components: a total summary represented as a volcano plot of phosphorylation sites and the kinases known to phosphylate at the given modified residue, a filtered kinase only volcano plot and relative kinase activity table that can be downloaded.<p>
